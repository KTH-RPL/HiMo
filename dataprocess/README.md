Due to policy, we cannot provide the raw Scania dataset file.

While to let user understand how I extract the h5 files, I upload the [extract_sca.py] script still to this repository. (It's not runnable but a good reference).


- [ ] We will directly provide the validation .h5 files for users to test the model and upload the results to the leaderboard.
